	<span class="first-word">Since</span> quitting my corporate job, I've had to be much more intentional with what I am spending my days doing.  Of course, I had that whole wedding thing which became my full-time job for a month after leaving my job. But where do I stand now, now that the dust has settled and I am exposed as a black canvas of nothingness coupled with endless possibilities? What am I holding on to as my identity today? Society is so weird...we always need something else to mark and identify, as if just being is not enough validation. And worse yet, we often let others define us and limit what we can do. No, I will not be your corporate b*tch anymore. Sorry.

	25 has been a year of transformation for me. I learned so much more about life than any other year of my existence. I was excited to become Mrs. Candice Dalan, to change my name and shed the skin of many unsettled formative years. This was it -- my big arrival, and yes, I'm all in this time. But as I'm finding out, there is no such thing as arriving. My brokenness, my mistakes, my everything, will always be a part of my journey. Nothing ever gets magically erased. The journey never abruptly stops and start anew. I have not arrived. But who I am today doesn't have to be who I am tomorrow. The choices I made at 13, 17, and 20 do not have to be the choices I make moving forward. Even though our past will forever be a part of our journey, we need the courage to let it go so that we have the strength to move forward.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As I am in this state of free-falling, of letting go of one thing before I have anything else to hold on to, I saw a window open. I had the strong urge to fly out this window and explore the other side. My twin, my beloved other half I have mentioned several times on this blog, is writing her first book. She has had a difficult last few years, getting pregnant, planning a shot-gun wedding, calling it off, and moving across the country to find her footing (you can read more about her story on her old blog). She is finally ready to let her past go, and this healing comes in the form of her writing a book. I am signing on as her editor, and will be spending the next several months helping her shape her story for the world to see.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	There is no such thing as arriving, but I am sure thankful for my journey.
