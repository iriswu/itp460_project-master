		<span class="first-word">Yes</span>, I know I had another post planned but I woke up today feeling so compelled to write this one and want to document how yesterday was for me. Yesterday was my last day at my retail management job. When I first put in my two weeks, I felt as though the hugest weight was lifted from my shoulders. I felt like I had walked through a hazy existence and was about to enter my real life. A colleague gave me the advice that I should not "act too happy" for my last two weeks. But I couldn't help it! I was glowing a new glow and there was nothing I could do to stop it.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I opened the store yesterday and spent the day prancing around with a sense of calm and purpose: this is my last shift here, ever. Nothing was going to bring me down. However, about 30 minutes before I left, I was hit by a strong wave of sadness. This is my last shift here, ever. As my team said their goodbyes to me, the knot in my throat kept growing. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		As I ran out the store and into my car, I might have shed a tear or two. Okay, I flat-out bawled in my car. The last two years of my life ran through my head and I couldn't believe it was over. I sent my parents a quick text to let them know how I was doing and my dad sent to me: "The emotional impact can be significant when so many life-turning events all arrive at the same point. Regardless of what may come, I still feel happy for you that you are able to come forward and move into a new chapter of your life."
		</p>	
		
		<p>
		I sure hope so. As much as I was starting to resent my job, I have to be grateful for everything that came out of this experience. My job gave me the means to buy my first house with Lane. It gave me the opportunity to go back to school for my MBA. I got to realize at the age of 25 what I want and don't want in a job moving forward. But most importantly, I had the chance to meet some pretty amazing people and together, we overcame the many treacherous obstacles we faced in the last two years. I didn't realize this until yesterday, but the team had become my community in this area. And for that, I will always be grateful.

		I woke up today with no where to be and no one to see. The road is open and free.

		<p>
		Here I go.
