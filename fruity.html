	<span class="first-word">Something</span> Lane and I struggle with is getting enough greens in our diets. I just don't like eating salads, which is shocking for those who know me because I am so health conscious. I try sneaking greens into my fruit smoothies (just add a couple handfuls of spinach into an all fruit smoothie -- you won't even know it's there!) but recently have decided to bring back my tried and true green lemonade recipe. I definitely did not come up with this recipe -- it's been floating around in cyber space for so long but I've had it in my arsenal for almost 10 years so I feel like it's mine! 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	You can run all these ingredients through a juicer for a smoother drink. Lane and I prefer to drink a blended version so that all the fiber is in tact. Simply blend together:
	
		<ul>
			<li>1 whole cucumber</li>
			<li>4-5 stalks of celery</li>
			<li>2 large handfuls of spinach</li>
			<li>the juice of 3 lemons</li>
			<li>1 large or 2 small apples, unpeeled</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We buy all our produce from Trader Joe's and we always buy organic for any of our green produce. I won't eat apples either unless it's organic. My general rule of thumb is if I eat the skin of the fruit, it must be organic. Here is a link for produce you should always get organic. 	
	</p>
	
	<p>
    This boy keeps me honest. When I get lazy and don't make us green lemonade, he'll ask for it by name! I can never say no to him.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	So why is green lemonade so amazing? Well, first of all, it's nutrient dense with all those wonderful greens and it's easy to digest because it's all blended together. The drink is also oh-so-hydrating because of that whole cucumber. My favorite part of my green lemonade? It supports alkalinity in our bodies. I will try and explain it as simply and basic as possible: our bodies are always trying to establish a balance between acidity and alkalinity, and for optimum wellness, we want a slightly more alkaline body. However, many modern habits produce more acidity in our bodies, and foods such as sugar, wheat, dairy, coffee, and meat all are acid-forming. Also, stress and pollution make our bodies more acidic as well. Greens and lemons are super alkaline (I know it seems like lemons would be acidic for our bodies but the opposite is true!) and drinking my green lemonade supports a more alkaline body. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We drink this now everyday before dinner. It digests super-cleanly and acts like a palate cleanser. Green lemonade is refreshing and slightly sweet from the apples -- it can't be beat! Try it and support your wellness today.
