	<h2 class="article-header">How One Direction Changed My Life<br /> <span class="article-date">MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 2012</span></h2>
</div>

<div id="article-body">

	<p>
	<span class="first-word">It</span> was a simple summer Thursday. Lane and I had an informal game night and at the end of the night, only one other girl remained. We finished off a bottle of cheap wine and decided that it would be a good idea to watch all our favorite music videos blown up on our 60" TV. After a few rounds of bouncy pop songs, I suggested the summer hit "What Makes You Beautiful" by One Direction. I had never seen the music video but was curious enough.
	</p>	
	
	<p>
	As these 18-year-olds appeared on my screen, larger than life and frolicking along some beach with their floppy hair, I couldn't stop giggling, blushing, and saying "oh my gawd!". Here I am, a 25-year-old soon to be married corporate professional completely buckling and becoming weak at the knees for a boy band.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I spent the next few days on a complete One Direction high. I Googled and Youtubed everything I could about them, watching live performances and wondering which boy I was most astrologically compatible with (Harry, I'm looking at you). Something about these guys made me feel alive and I realized I was envious of their vitality, their hunger and drive chasing relentlessly after their dreams. Somewhere in the last few post-college years, I had lost that anything-is-possible mentality and settled upon an expected life, working a job I don't love and searching for God knows what. I lost the courage to fight for the things I believe in and instead settled for whatever came the easiest. I could justify up and down that I am successful and happy, but One Direction made me realize I had to make some changes and not give up on me. I, too, can be sparkling happy and full of life.
