<div id="article-body">		
		
			<p>
			<span class="first-word">As</span> a tween, my greatest desire was to change my hair color. I believed in the "blondes have more fun" sentiment and saw so many things wrong with my dark brown hair and so many things right with any shade lighter than Espresso. Of course, my parents wouldn't let me dye my hair yet but I convinced them to buy me Sun-In (a product you spray in your hair to lighten it gradually with sun exposure) and used this product during every soccer practice. Over the course of a few weeks, my once healthy hair turned into a frizzy mass of streaky, brassy bronze -- but I was hooked. Anything was better than my real hair color.	
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Sun-In was my gateway drug to boxed hair dye, and by the time I was 14, I became a DIY hair color wannabe expert. About once every few months, I would buy a box of hair dye (discretely -- even thought my parents knew what was going on, I didn't want to rub it in their faces) and 45 minutes later, I would have a new me. After my first breakup with a boyfriend in high school, I decided it was time to join the big leagues and got my hair colored and highlighted professionally. FYI -- just because something is done by a "professional" doesn't mean it's better. By senior year in high school, I was switching between summery highlights and raven black every few months. And I started to notice a trend: anytime I wasn't feeling great about myself, I would make a hair appointment and change my look. Because that always solves the problem, right? What I also realized was that after breakups, I would go the lightest in hair color. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			During the summer of 2007, I decided once and for all to stop dyeing my hair and to end this cycle of highlights, black hair, lighter highlights, and more goth-y black hair. I endured two years of painful two-tone hair while new hair grew in and finally, during the winter of 2009, the last bit of dyed hair was cut off. I had never felt more free and here are the three reasons why I finally stopped dyeing my hair:
			</p>
			
			<p>
			1. It's expensive: Getting my hair highlighted costed at least $75 each time (and these were prices from almost six years ago) and then I had to maintain my roots by going back to the salon for touch-ups and then I would dye it to a solid color at home and then I had to go back and get more highlights and then the roots would start showing again and then. It just never ended. It was a money pit and an expensive habit to have because the coloring just never ended. There were always touch-ups needed. I am happy to report that since the summer of 2007, I have spent exactly $0 on hair coloring.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			2. It's unhealthy: Think about it. You are rubbing this chemically substance into your scalp, a super absorbent area of skin, and letting this toxic mixture go into your blood stream. Yuck. Plus, you are inhaling the fumes from hair coloring every time you dye your hair. And your hair loses its structural integrity from the hair dye and becomes brittle and frizzy and gross. To compensate, you spend more $$ on hair care products to make it look shiny and nice, further supporting reason #1.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			3. It showed me I wasn't okay with who I am: Why did I feel this need to change my hair color instead of embracing who I am and how I was born? Why did I comfort myself when I was down by changing my hair color instead of dealing with the real issues at hand? Why am I forsaking my Chinese identity by believing lighter hair is better?
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Perhaps reason #3 was the biggest reason why I stopped dyeing my hair. I finally started the journey of loving and embracing myself. I suddenly realized that how I come is good enough, that I don't need to alter or discolor myself to thrive in this world. I just need to be me.
