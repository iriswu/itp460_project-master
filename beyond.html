		<h2 class="article-header">Who I Should Be<span class="article-date">FRIDAY, JANUARY 18, 2013</span></h2>
	
	
	<p>
	Something I've struggled with for years, and still sometimes struggle with, is the concept of who I should be versus who I am. Even though the expectations for people in my demographic are mostly implicit, the pressure of my "should be's" are strong. I should be career driven. I should put off having kids until I have my foot in the door (what door?) and my career defined. I should be part of the rat race and constantly upgrade the "toys" (house, cars, etc.) in my life. I should eat a healthy balanced diet with a little bit of everything. Meat and animal products included. I should put more time into managing how people perceive me and grow my network. I should want more, bigger, and better. Always. But I don't.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I'm done putting energy into things I am supposed to care about. I now want to focus on things that actually matter to me in life. Like my family. My hubby. My health. The simple, organic lifestyle. My happiness and well-being. My community. I want my husband to join me in the freedom lifestyle, to not be over-worked and stressed. But how? How do we carve our path when this society clearly supports a way of life we don't want? We are finding the answers to our questions, slowly but surely. We question everything along the way, and know that the best thing we can do is to trust our hearts. The journey is not clearly defined, and there is no end. But we have committed to letting go of the should be's. And that is a good enough start for us.
	</p>
	<p>
	My words have been few recently, as much of my journey is inward for now. Lots of healing and growth are taking place. But I wish to share it all with the world one day. To share the light and love that exists.

	<p>
	With the start of the new year comes the obligatory reflection of how life has been in the past and new resolutions for the future. However, playing this little exercise with my twin sister started us on the wrong path. Between the two of us, our 20s has been nothing short of completely tumultuous and we recounted tales of failed businesses, cancelled weddings, baby out of wedlock, missed opportunities, numerous job changes (well, this one's just been me), and general misconduct that we choose to constantly blast in a public forum. Like on this blog. And hers.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Anyway. I don't know about resolutions anymore. To me, they are too transactional and task-driven. Run marathon. Check. Buy house. Check. Get married. Check. Instead of a "to do" list this year, what about a "to be" list? A list of attributes and states of mind I want to be in as I navigate yet another year of the roaring 20s? Here are my "to be's" (is this grammatically correct?) for the year:   
	
		<ol>
			<li>Have gratitude -- We all know how momentary happiness is. Once we get what we want, that glorious feeling of elation eventually fades. But why let it? Why not be in a constant state of gratitude for the things/people/experiences that we have in life? Why not be grateful for the simple joys in life and focus on the good? I will count my blessing every day, multiple times a day, for just how good I have it. The bad stuff in life just doesn't deserve my energy anymore. I will open my heart and shine light on my life.</li>
			<li>Be present -- I've been told, and know to be true, that I am not an active listener. I will look at someone like I am listening to them but my mind has already sped off into another topic completely unrelated. It's not that I don't care about what they are saying...well, I guess my actions sure make it seem that way. This year, I will focus on being present in life and my presence in general. I will savor every moment in this crazy sexy life and not shut people out with my actions. A simple exercise to support this "to be" is to not use my phone when I am talking to others. How rude is texting while having a conversation with someone? But I do it all the time. I love multitasking. But this takes away from my interactions with others and takes away from the experience we are sharing. I think we text while talking to others not just to multitask but also to fill the "uncomfortable" silences. But let's enjoy them instead. So if I text while talking to you, please call me out on it. What I'm texting is not nearly as important as this moment I'm sharing with you.</li>
			<li>Have faith -- This "to be" is what originally inspired this post. While texting with my sister (and possibly having a conversation with someone else) about how up and down and down our 20s have been, I spouted out these words of wisdom:Have faith that everything turns out more or less how it's supposed to be. I felt divinely inspired and just had to let her know. In the end, it will all be okay. And knowing this, let's allow ourselves to enjoy the present.</li>

		<h2 class="article-header">Holiday Review and Cleansing "Stuff" From My Life<span class="article-date">FRIDAY, JANUARY 4, 2013</span></h2>
	
	
	<p>
	Hello. It's been a while. I have been on a whirlwind trip to St. Louis and Chicago the last ten days over the holiday season. I remember last year, when I was still working my retail management job, dropping Lane off at the airport on Christmas day so he could spend the holidays with his family and friends while I stayed behind. I spent most of the holiday season either at work or in bed watching mindless shows on Netflix. On New Year's Eve, I watched at least 1.5 seasons of How I Met Your Mother in bed and at midnight, I made the silent resolution that I would never again choose work over spending time with the people I love most in life. I guess that resolution was not so silent when I quit my job several months after.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Anyway, while having dinner in St. Louis this year with Lane's sister, she mentioned an idea she had that we should consider alternatives to exchanging gifts. She proposed that instead of spending money on "stuff" for each other, we should deposit money into travel funds so we can take vacations together. It's crazy because I had been starting to cleanse useless stuff and obligatory gift exchanges from my life and somehow she was on the same wavelength. I mean, how many times have you been roped into an office white elephant party and received a meaningless plastic trinket that you donated to the Salvation Army the next day? Happened to me all the time.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	So here we are, taking the stance that we will no longer buy someone's affection with "stuff" they don't need. Rather, give me your time and let's share an experience together. Let's travel the world and connect in a way that's not superficial. I still appreciate practical gifts (I wanted to register for toilet paper on my wedding registry) but no more I am buying this for you because I need to buy you a gift exchanges. Let's cut the crap and get to the good stuff in life.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	So this all sounds great about no longer buying gifts and creating travel funds, but we had already bought all our gifts for each other this year. And most of it was already wrapped. Lane's sister had the genius suggestion that we would exchange and unwrap gifts anyway this year, and then return them. So that's what we did. We had the satisfaction of unwrapping presents without the cost. And we are all just a little bit closer to our next vacation together.

		<h2 class="article-header">How to Have Your Dream Wedding Without Having to Take Out a Second Mortgage<span class="article-date">MONDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 2012</span></h2>
	
	
	<p>
	Today officially marks one month since Lane and I got married. To celebrate my one month wedding anniversary with Lane, I've decided to write a blog post about how I was able to have my dream wedding without breaking the bank or taking out a second mortgage (sad, but true -- I know of people who have taken out loans for their wedding!). 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	First, here is the number one rule: never, ever, EVER throw a wedding with money you don't have. If you need to take out a loan of any sort, then it's time to think about other options. Remember, as spectacular and amazing as wedding days can be, it ultimately is just ONE day in your life. It's not worth going into debt for. Plus, there are so many ways you can be cost-effective. We chose to have our wedding on a Friday, which cost less than having it on a Saturday or Sunday. We also booked our venue when it was under renovations so we got an additional 15% off. We kept our wedding intimate with just over 70 guests, making costs for food and beverages much more manageable. We saved even more money because we didn't exchange wedding rings -- we don't value symbols and both hate wearing jewelry. Similarly, I didn't buy a garter for a garter toss, had cupcakes instead of a cake (we had Sprinkles cupcakes which our guests LOVED and it cost only half as much as a cake would've), and wore shoes we already own (I know shoes seem like a small detail but brides go crazy spending big $$$ on Jimmy Choos). Another important thing -- get your guests as involved as possible! I wanted everyone to feel engaged at my wedding (have you ever been to a wedding where you just didn't care to be there?) so many people had roles outside of just being a guest. Utilize their talents and resources. I collected glass jars from many family, friends, and neighbors. My sister and godfather were my photographers. And so on.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	So remember, just use your creativity and tap into your resources. Let your guests be a part of the experience. Just because something is a tradition doesn't mean you have to have it at your wedding. No need to spend money on silly traditions you don't care about. Also, just because something costs more doesn't mean it's better. And lastly, the most important element to our wedding was our amazing family and friends. With the right people, any event will be spectacular. And friends and family are priceless. :-)

		<h2 class="article-header">A Practice in Self-Acceptance<span class="article-date">THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 2012</span></h2>
	
	<p>
	Today, I had Thanksgiving dinner at my Godparents' house. They had another family over and the wife asked if I was still working in retail. "Oh no, I quit right before my wedding because I felt like I was betraying myself everyday at work." And so on. She said, "Wow, every time we see you, it seems like you had just quit a job." Her comment made me face a reality I tried not to think about. I counted and I've had eight jobs in the last two and half years. From being a receptionist at an insurance company to a creative writer for a start-up, I am a serial job-hopper. My pattern is always the same. I get very excited for a job opportunity, bring my A game to work, and then very quickly realize I am disengaged and start dreading going to work. Of course, I am not in this state of dread for very long because then I would go to my boss and be more honest than most employees would ever think of being. In fact, I went to the CEO of a company I worked for once and told him I did not like my job. The aftermath of that conversation can be saved for another post.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As Oprah loves to say, this realization that I've had so many different jobs in such a short amount of time became my "Ah-ha!" moment. Ah-ha! Maybe I am just not cut out to work a "normal" job. The nine to five desk job, working in an industry no one could possibly be passionate about, is just not for me. I don't want to climb the corporate ladder. I want to carve my own path and work on projects that keep me up at night feeling like electricity is flowing through my body. I don't want to think, in five years, I should be promoted to a director and in seven years, I will be a vice president. These arbitrary titles mean nothing to me. I accept that I am not the norm, that I have the courage to say, I DON'T WANT THESE THINGS! I want to go to bed at night knowing that I spent my precious, God-given time on something that contributes to the betterment of humanity as a whole, something that extends beyond just a company's mission statement. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I could mope and think, what is wrong with me?! Why can't I be like my peers and just stay with a company? Why do I always stick out like a sore thumb? But today, I am accepting that I want something else, something more. I accept that I want to live the courageous life and not work just for financial gain. Today, I know this sense of urgency I feel in having to do something more with my life must be fully explored and acted upon. Today, I will have FAITH that something will break my fall from corporate America. And for that, I am very grateful.

	<p>
	Since quitting my corporate job, I've had to be much more intentional with what I am spending my days doing.  Of course, I had that whole wedding thing which became my full-time job for a month after leaving my job. But where do I stand now, now that the dust has settled and I am exposed as a black canvas of nothingness coupled with endless possibilities? What am I holding on to as my identity today? Society is so weird...we always need something else to mark and identify, as if just being is not enough validation. And worse yet, we often let others define us and limit what we can do. No, I will not be your corporate b*tch anymore. Sorry.
	</p>	
	
	<p>
	25 has been a year of transformation for me. I learned so much more about life than any other year of my existence. I was excited to become Mrs. Candice Dalan, to change my name and shed the skin of many unsettled formative years. This was it -- my big arrival, and yes, I'm all in this time. But as I'm finding out, there is no such thing as arriving. My brokenness, my mistakes, my everything, will always be a part of my journey. Nothing ever gets magically erased. The journey never abruptly stops and start anew. I have not arrived. But who I am today doesn't have to be who I am tomorrow. The choices I made at 13, 17, and 20 do not have to be the choices I make moving forward. Even though our past will forever be a part of our journey, we need the courage to let it go so that we have the strength to move forward.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As I am in this state of free-falling, of letting go of one thing before I have anything else to hold on to, I saw a window open. I had the strong urge to fly out this window and explore the other side. My twin, my beloved other half I have mentioned several times on this blog, is writing her first book. She has had a difficult last few years, getting pregnant, planning a shot-gun wedding, calling it off, and moving across the country to find her footing (you can read more about her story on her old blog). She is finally ready to let her past go, and this healing comes in the form of her writing a book. I am signing on as her editor, and will be spending the next several months helping her shape her story for the world to see.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	There is no such thing as arriving, but I am sure thankful for my journey.

		<h2 class="article-header">I Just Wanted to Say That You Changed My Life<span class="article-date">THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2012</span></h2>
		
	<p>
	The universe works in mysterious ways. I don't believe in coincidences and I had a fated moment yesterday that took my breath away.
	</p>	
	
	<p>
	Lane and I met through my sister's high school sweetheart (let's just call him Peter). Lane and Peter were roommates one summer during college when both of them interned at the same aerospace firm. Long story short, Peter introduced me to Lane and I've been captivated with Lane ever since. However, we all lost touch with Peter shortly after for the next five years, which is sad because he was once a great family friend. Life moved on but I always wondered if Peter knew he introduced me to the love of my life.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Now fast forward to a week after our wedding. I had this unsettled feeling that I should've reached out to Peter to let him know Lane and I were getting married. I regretted not inviting him to the wedding but it was such an intimate occasion that someone we hadn't spoken to in five years might seem misplaced. Peter doesn't use his Facebook profile and we don't have mutual friends -- I don't even know what part of the country he's in. How can I contact him just to say, you changed my life? 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Yesterday, my bridesmaid Christel sent me this text message: I think I am standing behind Chris's ex-boyfriend Peter right now. She was waiting in line at a club in San Francisco and I begged her to say hi for me. I'm not saying hi. He probs doesn't remember me and it'll be awkward.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
	But within a few moments, I get a call from Christel's phone and I hear Peter on the other line. In this loud club in San Francisco, after not keeping in contact for five years, he calls to say he is thrilled for us. That I sound exactly the same. And to send his love to Lane. Just before he disappears back into the hazy, rhythmic club, I say, "Thank you. You changed my life. " And I swear I heard him smile.

	<p>
	This past Friday, I officially became Mrs. Dalan. Lane and I had an intimate celebration in Downtown Los Angeles and it was spectacular. 
	</p>	
	
	<p>
	I remember one night a week before the wedding when my twin and I were curled up in bed crying because of how overwhelmed we felt about the wedding. I kept wondering if I made the right decision to have a wedding instead of just eloping. In the end, I have no regrets. To me, having my family and closest friends celebrating with us in gritty LA under sparkly stars made everything worth it. I wish I could go back and relive the day over and over again. In the moment, there were so many things going on that I just couldn't process it all. It was such a personalized event that every detail meant a million things to me. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	 I am so blessed and grateful for the people who made this event possible for us (which is pretty much every guest). They were all committed until the end.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Here is a video of our ceremony processional and exit.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We walked down the aisle to an acoustic version of Taylor Swift's "Fearless". A few days after the wedding, as we were rehashing the event during a final family dinner, "Fearless" played at the restaurant we were at. It's not a popular song and not something I'd ever heard anywhere but online.  I took this as a nod from above acknowledging our wedding. We are truly fearless as we start this new journey together. :-)

	These days, my mind space is taken up by thoughts of tulle, paper flowers, tray-passed appetizers, and dance music. Yes, the wedding planning is still in full swing and it is my full-time job to ensure my most loved family and friends have the event of a lifetime.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I spend my days coordinating vendors, making countless trips to Michael's, and folding paper flowers until my fingers become so stiff I feel like I have arthritis.  I come home with paper cuts all over my hands from the flowers and Lane complains that the wedding is so stressful. What will we ever do with the men?
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Music has always been a huge part of my life so the music playlist has to be perfect (#firstworldproblems). But, I realized my "Do Not Play" list is ever growing:

			<li>no Chicken Dance</li>
			<li>no Sweet Home Alabama</li>

	Yeah, not going to lie. That post about how I am able to quit my job without another lined up is just happening. Not now, anyway. Every waking moment I've had the past 10 days have been given to my wedding. The prep just never ends. I have my mom, dad, mother-in-law, godparents, and twin sister working around the clock and moving mountains to make this wedding happen. I am exhausted, spent, and don't know how much more I can give. I've doubted every decision, blurred the vision I had so clearly of how I want my wedding to be. It's been a roller coaster of highest highs and so many breakdowns. I am picking myself apart because the pressure to be perfect for my wedding day is just so great. Of course, this is all self-inflicted pressure. But still. After my last episode of tears, I decided I need to step away from wedding planning and write a blog post instead.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I just need to remember why I am doing this: To celebrate my marriage to the most incredible person in my life. I am marrying my best friend at the end of this month.

		<p>
		Yes, I know I had another post planned but I woke up today feeling so compelled to write this one and want to document how yesterday was for me. Yesterday was my last day at my retail management job. When I first put in my two weeks, I felt as though the hugest weight was lifted from my shoulders. I felt like I had walked through a hazy existence and was about to enter my real life. A colleague gave me the advice that I should not "act too happy" for my last two weeks. But I couldn't help it! I was glowing a new glow and there was nothing I could do to stop it.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I opened the store yesterday and spent the day prancing around with a sense of calm and purpose: this is my last shift here, ever. Nothing was going to bring me down. However, about 30 minutes before I left, I was hit by a strong wave of sadness. This is my last shift here, ever. As my team said their goodbyes to me, the knot in my throat kept growing. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		As I ran out the store and into my car, I might have shed a tear or two. Okay, I flat-out bawled in my car. The last two years of my life ran through my head and I couldn't believe it was over. I sent my parents a quick text to let them know how I was doing and my dad sent to me: "The emotional impact can be significant when so many life-turning events all arrive at the same point. Regardless of what may come, I still feel happy for you that you are able to come forward and move into a new chapter of your life."
		</p>	
		
		<p>
		I sure hope so. As much as I was starting to resent my job, I have to be grateful for everything that came out of this experience. My job gave me the means to buy my first house with Lane. It gave me the opportunity to go back to school for my MBA. I got to realize at the age of 25 what I want and don't want in a job moving forward. But most importantly, I had the chance to meet some pretty amazing people and together, we overcame the many treacherous obstacles we faced in the last two years. I didn't realize this until yesterday, but the team had become my community in this area. And for that, I will always be grateful.

		<h2 class="article-header">Why I Quit My Corporate Job<span class="article-date">Tuesday, SEPTEMBER 25, 2012</span></h2>
		
	<p>
	Yes, the rumors are true: I have officially resigned from my corporate retail management job. You might remember from this post when I confessed that some big things needed to change about my life. And this was the biggest. My last day with this company will be on Thursday. It took me two months to fully make this decision but once I committed to it, I felt such an overwhelming sense of peace that I knew I did the right thing.
	</p>
	
	<p class="quote">
	"It's like drinking poison and hoping you don't taste it on the way down."
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I had this long, drawn out post written about all the reasons why I'm quitting. I ranted on and on about how my job has made me sick 10 times in the last year and a half, about how I work in a fluorescent light bulb-lit box handling everything from cash to trash to sick customers. But I've decided I don't want to vent about the petty things, because every job has its petty drawbacks. There really is only one over-arching reason for why I left my job: I felt like I was betraying myself every day I walked into the building.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Oprah had a guest on her show explain self-betrayal recently and I realized I was the one letting my soul hurt everyday. A recruiter contacted me for this job back in November 2010 and I decided I would try it out. I did more than try, actually. I drank the Kool Aid hard and lived and breathed my job for a full year straight. But during this time, I started losing myself as a person, losing my voice and coming undone. Deep down, I knew something was terribly off, but I kept subjecting myself to this misery. It's like drinking poison and hoping you don't taste it on the way down.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Fueled by the Kool Aid, I believed in what I was doing, in the team I was building, and in the sales I was driving. But slowly, and then very quickly, I started seeing what corporate America is all about. I realized "Do you want fries with that?" comes in many different forms and everyone around me started sounding like robots. Peers I had originally respected started conforming and losing their individual self worth. And the worst part is that their conformity was viewed as success by upper management. I realized we were all taught what to say, how to think, and how to cage those around us.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I also looked at the people in upper management and rather than feeling inspired and motivated, I felt a sense of dread: I don't want to be them when I grow up. But I was on the path to. I saw my career path and felt like I was settling in life. I never dreamed about being a retail manager so why am I settling in life? Why did I give up on myself by the time I was 25?
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I truly believe everyone has a life purpose and something she is supposed to contribute to the world. Working a no-impact job as a cog in the wheel for corporate America is so purposeless that I was simply selling my time for money.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Two months ago, I was at a crossroads and saw one path lead towards success in corporate America (remember, "success" equals conformity in the corporate world). The other path led towards a journey of freedom, hope, and purpose.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I am choosing the second path, the one that makes me feel alive again.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I have no other job lined up. Because I just woke up from a very nightmarish reality, I need time to adjust to my new sense of self. I need time to figure out what this all means for me. I stayed at this job for much longer than I should have, especially during the last two months when my heart was ready to burst and get me out of there. All I know right now is that I will never betray myself again. I will just live my truth, fearlessly.

		<h2 class="article-header">Why Cable Is For Dummies<span class="article-date">THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2012</span></h2>
		
		<p>
		Growing up, I worshiped cable. Watching TV was all I wanted to do and all I did when given the chance. My summers consisted of lying on the couch all day watching the summer lineups on my favorite channels, including Disney, Nickelodeon, TLC, and the Food Network. What made this experience even better was mindlessly eating prepackaged food while watching show after show. Sure, I did other things such as karate and swim lessons during the summer time, but those commitments only took up 2-3 hours every day. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I had a friend who didn't have cable and I remember being so shocked when he told me. "So what do you do all day?!", I naively asked. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Ever since I moved out of my parents' house, I vowed to never have cable TV again. The reason why is because the more I opened my eyes, the more I realized how cable is for dummies. It seriously is a brain drain and I wish I had those summers back so I could've done something productive and meaningful with my time. It depresses me to think about all the hours I lost in my life to TV.
		
			<ol>
				<li>Cable costs money. Yes, unless you are mooching off of your neighbor, cable is going to run you $50-200 every month. That's a lot of money to be spending on something you don't need. That's enough money for a week's worth of groceries or to fund a new hobby or two every month. And if there is a show you HAVE to watch, you can probably find it for free online.</li>
				<li>Cable makes you a slave. A reason why cable TV is appealing to some is because you can watch an episode when it first premieres. However, then you have to adjust your life to fit around its scheduling. I can't even tell you how many times a phone conversation has been cut short because "My favorite show is on now!" or "I need to go watch my show!". People become slaves to their TV. A great example is my dad, who has a bazillion channels and records shows all the time. He gets stressed out if he can't watch everything because he needs more space to record even more shows. So it becomes this endless cycle of recording, watching, erasing, and recording more. It just never ends. And yes, it's very stressful for him. </li>
				<li>Cable makes you passive. And fat. You are sitting in front of a TV for hours on end, probably killing time and eating whatever junk you have in your house. Rather than taking a jog or having dinner with your friend, you are just sitting and watching a box. I can't even recall most of the stuff I've watched, proving how passive we become when watching TV. Very rarely is anything retained.</li>
				<li>Cable subjects you to hardcore marketing. 20 minutes out of every hour is spent on commercials. That's one third of your time watching TV that yet another plastic junk or fast food chain is marketed to you. Have you ever seen a commercial where the product or food marketed is something you actually need or is going to enrich your life?</li>
				<li>Cable is a clutch. My sister lets the TV run 24/7 because she likes the background noise. Another person I know can only fall asleep with the TV on. Is this normal?</li>
				<li></li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		So break free, cut out the noise, and find yourself. Embrace silence. Cherish your time. And enjoy your life. I promise you won't regret it.

		<h2 class="article-header">How I Lost Money Working My First Job<span class="article-date">TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2012</span></h2>
		
	<p>
	My twin sister and I have always wanted to work. Something about making our own money was so appealing and our shot at our first job came the the fall of 2000. We were 13 years old and our neighbor came to our house looking for a sub for her son's paper route. He was going out of town for a week and she wondered if we would take his route while he was gone. We were completely in disbelief that our neighbor thought we were responsible enough for such a task. This was our big break. With an immense sense of pride, we agreed to shadow her son for two days to learn the ropes.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	And so the week went. We folded, rubber banded, and delivered newspapers to our entire neighborhood everyday after school. We quickly learned the fastest route to take and even enlisted my brother and his friend to help us fold newspapers. This wasn't so bad and we would be paid $60 by the end of the week! The only day we were dreading was our last day of work, which was a Sunday. Sundays played by a different set of rules and all newspapers had to be delivered by 7am, which meant we needed to wake up at 4:30am to start folding. I remember my sister and I getting out of bed and setting up shop in the garage with wind howling outside and us shivering in the cold.  Somehow, we made it through the darkness on our bikes and had every house delivered except for one last row of houses. We sighed with relief and decided that the quickest way to complete this last set was to throw the newspaper on the porch rather than walking it up. This was a great plan and by our last house, I had gotten really confident with my throwing. I took a deep breathe and threw the newspaper on the porch. Except it didn't hit the porch. I had thrown it at a window and the window cracked. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We heard the people inside say, "What was that?!", and of course the logical thing to do was to hit our bikes and get the heck out of there. When we got home, we confessed to our parents what had happened and they insisted we go back and let the people know. Long story short, the window cost $100 to fix so the $60 we made went straight into the window, along with an additional $40. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We were down for a while about this whole experience but rather than letting it keep us down, we moved on. Our neighbor's son eventually offered us his route permanently, and along with our younger brother, we built a monopoly of newspaper routes in our town. Doing the paper route every day gave us exposure to many of our neighbors who offered us babysitting jobs on the side. By the time I was 16, I had saved $4,500 from my jobs, all stemmed from that ill-fated first week.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The moral of this story is that breaking windows and falling down will happen. Just don't let it discourage you from getting back up and taking another swing at it.

		<h2 class="article-header">How One Direction Changed My Life<span class="article-date">MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 2012</span></h2>
		
	<p>
	It was a simple summer Thursday. Lane and I had an informal game night and at the end of the night, only one other girl remained. We finished off a bottle of cheap wine and decided that it would be a good idea to watch all our favorite music videos blown up on our 60" TV. After a few rounds of bouncy pop songs, I suggested the summer hit "What Makes You Beautiful" by One Direction. I had never seen the music video but was curious enough.
	</p>	
	
	<p>
	As these 18-year-olds appeared on my screen, larger than life and frolicking along some beach with their floppy hair, I couldn't stop giggling, blushing, and saying "oh my gawd!". Here I am, a 25-year-old soon to be married corporate professional completely buckling and becoming weak at the knees for a boy band.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I spent the next few days on a complete One Direction high. I Googled and Youtubed everything I could about them, watching live performances and wondering which boy I was most astrologically compatible with (Harry, I'm looking at you). Something about these guys made me feel alive and I realized I was envious of their vitality, their hunger and drive chasing relentlessly after their dreams. Somewhere in the last few post-college years, I had lost that anything-is-possible mentality and settled upon an expected life, working a job I don't love and searching for God knows what. I lost the courage to fight for the things I believe in and instead settled for whatever came the easiest. I could justify up and down that I am successful and happy, but One Direction made me realize I had to make some changes and not give up on me. I, too, can be sparkling happy and full of life.
