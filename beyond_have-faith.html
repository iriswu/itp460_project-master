	<span class="first-word">With</span> the start of the new year comes the obligatory reflection of how life has been in the past and new resolutions for the future. However, playing this little exercise with my twin sister started us on the wrong path. Between the two of us, our 20s has been nothing short of completely tumultuous and we recounted tales of failed businesses, cancelled weddings, baby out of wedlock, missed opportunities, numerous job changes (well, this one's just been me), and general misconduct that we choose to constantly blast in a public forum. Like on this blog. And hers.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Anyway. I don't know about resolutions anymore. To me, they are too transactional and task-driven. Run marathon. Check. Buy house. Check. Get married. Check. Instead of a "to do" list this year, what about a "to be" list? A list of attributes and states of mind I want to be in as I navigate yet another year of the roaring 20s? Here are my "to be's" (is this grammatically correct?) for the year:   
	
		<ol>
			<li>Have gratitude -- We all know how momentary happiness is. Once we get what we want, that glorious feeling of elation eventually fades. But why let it? Why not be in a constant state of gratitude for the things/people/experiences that we have in life? Why not be grateful for the simple joys in life and focus on the good? I will count my blessing every day, multiple times a day, for just how good I have it. The bad stuff in life just doesn't deserve my energy anymore. I will open my heart and shine light on my life.</li>
			<li>Be present -- I've been told, and know to be true, that I am not an active listener. I will look at someone like I am listening to them but my mind has already sped off into another topic completely unrelated. It's not that I don't care about what they are saying...well, I guess my actions sure make it seem that way. This year, I will focus on being present in life and my presence in general. I will savor every moment in this crazy sexy life and not shut people out with my actions. A simple exercise to support this "to be" is to not use my phone when I am talking to others. How rude is texting while having a conversation with someone? But I do it all the time. I love multitasking. But this takes away from my interactions with others and takes away from the experience we are sharing. I think we text while talking to others not just to multitask but also to fill the "uncomfortable" silences. But let's enjoy them instead. So if I text while talking to you, please call me out on it. What I'm texting is not nearly as important as this moment I'm sharing with you.</li>
			<li>Have faith -- This "to be" is what originally inspired this post. While texting with my sister (and possibly having a conversation with someone else) about how up and down and down our 20s have been, I spouted out these words of wisdom:Have faith that everything turns out more or less how it's supposed to be. I felt divinely inspired and just had to let her know. In the end, it will all be okay. And knowing this, let's allow ourselves to enjoy the present.</li>
		</ol>
