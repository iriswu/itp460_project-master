<div id="article-body">

	<p>
	<span class="first-word">Hello</span>. It's been a while. I have been on a whirlwind trip to St. Louis and Chicago the last ten days over the holiday season. I remember last year, when I was still working my retail management job, dropping Lane off at the airport on Christmas day so he could spend the holidays with his family and friends while I stayed behind. I spent most of the holiday season either at work or in bed watching mindless shows on Netflix. On New Year's Eve, I watched at least 1.5 seasons of How I Met Your Mother in bed and at midnight, I made the silent resolution that I would never again choose work over spending time with the people I love most in life. I guess that resolution was not so silent when I quit my job several months after.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Anyway, while having dinner in St. Louis this year with Lane's sister, she mentioned an idea she had that we should consider alternatives to exchanging gifts. She proposed that instead of spending money on "stuff" for each other, we should deposit money into travel funds so we can take vacations together. It's crazy because I had been starting to cleanse useless stuff and obligatory gift exchanges from my life and somehow she was on the same wavelength. I mean, how many times have you been roped into an office white elephant party and received a meaningless plastic trinket that you donated to the Salvation Army the next day? Happened to me all the time.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	So here we are, taking the stance that we will no longer buy someone's affection with "stuff" they don't need. Rather, give me your time and let's share an experience together. Let's travel the world and connect in a way that's not superficial. I still appreciate practical gifts (I wanted to register for toilet paper on my wedding registry) but no more I am buying this for you because I need to buy you a gift exchanges. Let's cut the crap and get to the good stuff in life.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	So this all sounds great about no longer buying gifts and creating travel funds, but we had already bought all our gifts for each other this year. And most of it was already wrapped. Lane's sister had the genius suggestion that we would exchange and unwrap gifts anyway this year, and then return them. So that's what we did. We had the satisfaction of unwrapping presents without the cost. And we are all just a little bit closer to our next vacation together.
