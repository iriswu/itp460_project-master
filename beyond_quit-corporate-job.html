<div id="article-body">

	<p>
	<span class="first-word">Yes</span>, the rumors are true: I have officially resigned from my corporate retail management job. You might remember from this post when I confessed that some big things needed to change about my life. And this was the biggest. My last day with this company will be on Thursday. It took me two months to fully make this decision but once I committed to it, I felt such an overwhelming sense of peace that I knew I did the right thing.

	</p>
	
	<p>
	I had this long, drawn out post written about all the reasons why I'm quitting. I ranted on and on about how my job has made me sick 10 times in the last year and a half, about how I work in a fluorescent light bulb-lit box handling everything from cash to trash to sick customers. But I've decided I don't want to vent about the petty things, because every job has its petty drawbacks. There really is only one over-arching reason for why I left my job: I felt like I was betraying myself every day I walked into the building.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Oprah had a guest on her show explain self-betrayal recently and I realized I was the one letting my soul hurt everyday. A recruiter contacted me for this job back in November 2010 and I decided I would try it out. I did more than try, actually. I drank the Kool Aid hard and lived and breathed my job for a full year straight. But during this time, I started losing myself as a person, losing my voice and coming undone. Deep down, I knew something was terribly off, but I kept subjecting myself to this misery. It's like drinking poison and hoping you don't taste it on the way down.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Fueled by the Kool Aid, I believed in what I was doing, in the team I was building, and in the sales I was driving. But slowly, and then very quickly, I started seeing what corporate America is all about. I realized "Do you want fries with that?" comes in many different forms and everyone around me started sounding like robots. Peers I had originally respected started conforming and losing their individual self worth. And the worst part is that their conformity was viewed as success by upper management. I realized we were all taught what to say, how to think, and how to cage those around us.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I also looked at the people in upper management and rather than feeling inspired and motivated, I felt a sense of dread: I don't want to be them when I grow up. But I was on the path to. I saw my career path and felt like I was settling in life. I never dreamed about being a retail manager so why am I settling in life? Why did I give up on myself by the time I was 25?
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I truly believe everyone has a life purpose and something she is supposed to contribute to the world. Working a no-impact job as a cog in the wheel for corporate America is so purposeless that I was simply selling my time for money.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Two months ago, I was at a crossroads and saw one path lead towards success in corporate America (remember, "success" equals conformity in the corporate world). The other path led towards a journey of freedom, hope, and purpose.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I am choosing the second path, the one that makes me feel alive again.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I have no other job lined up. Because I just woke up from a very nightmarish reality, I need time to adjust to my new sense of self. I need time to figure out what this all means for me. I stayed at this job for much longer than I should have, especially during the last two months when my heart was ready to burst and get me out of there. All I know right now is that I will never betray myself again. I will just live my truth, fearlessly.
