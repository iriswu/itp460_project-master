	<span class="first-word">The</span> universe works in mysterious ways. I don't believe in coincidences and I had a fated moment yesterday that took my breath away.
	</p>	
	
	<p>
	Lane and I met through my sister's high school sweetheart (let's just call him Peter). Lane and Peter were roommates one summer during college when both of them interned at the same aerospace firm. Long story short, Peter introduced me to Lane and I've been captivated with Lane ever since. However, we all lost touch with Peter shortly after for the next five years, which is sad because he was once a great family friend. Life moved on but I always wondered if Peter knew he introduced me to the love of my life.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Now fast forward to a week after our wedding. I had this unsettled feeling that I should've reached out to Peter to let him know Lane and I were getting married. I regretted not inviting him to the wedding but it was such an intimate occasion that someone we hadn't spoken to in five years might seem misplaced. Peter doesn't use his Facebook profile and we don't have mutual friends -- I don't even know what part of the country he's in. How can I contact him just to say, you changed my life? 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Yesterday, my bridesmaid Christel sent me this text message: I think I am standing behind Chris's ex-boyfriend Peter right now. She was waiting in line at a club in San Francisco and I begged her to say hi for me. I'm not saying hi. He probs doesn't remember me and it'll be awkward.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
	But within a few moments, I get a call from Christel's phone and I hear Peter on the other line. In this loud club in San Francisco, after not keeping in contact for five years, he calls to say he is thrilled for us. That I sound exactly the same. And to send his love to Lane. Just before he disappears back into the hazy, rhythmic club, I say, "Thank you. You changed my life. " And I swear I heard him smile.
