	<span class="first-word">Perhaps</span> one of the greatest lies we are told as kids is that milk is good for us and makes us grow big and strong. However, if there is one food group on the Standard American Diet's food pyramid that I recommend all my friends eliminate first, it would be dairy. Humans are the only mammals to drink milk into adulthood and we don't even drink our own species' milk! I have always had a natural aversion to milk...it just tasted like vomit to me. Also, dairy products in general were not kind to my digestive system. I remember several birthday parties with cheese pizzas and ice cream where I spent the whole night miserable with sharp abdominal pains in the bathroom.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Cows are injected with growth hormones to produce an abnormal amount of milk. Their udders become infected, and the bloody and pus-y messes inevitably end up in our milk. Antibiotics are then used to control the bleeding and pus, and if there's any nutritional value left in milk after that, it all gets pasteurized out anyway. So fatty milk with growth hormones, blood, pus, and antibiotics??? No, thanks.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I want to share a quick story about milk and the affects it has on skin. When Lane and I first started dating, he always had issues with his skin. He tried Clearasil and Proactiv with little success. These products sort-of controlled his acne but left his sensitive skin dry and irritated. I noticed he drank a glass of milk with every meal and suggested that maybe the milk was causing his skin to break out. He was fed up with using such harsh chemicals on his skin so he agreed to cut out milk for a week. Within three days, he skin completely cleared up and within a few weeks, his skin was beautiful and glow-y.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	But don't let me tell you what to do -- there is so much misinformation out there about health and nutrition that the best way to separate fact from industry-driven fiction is to experiment and try things out for yourself. Give up dairy products for a week and see what changes you notice.
