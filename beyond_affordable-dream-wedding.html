	<span class="first-word">Today</span> officially marks one month since Lane and I got married. To celebrate my one month wedding anniversary with Lane, I've decided to write a blog post about how I was able to have my dream wedding without breaking the bank or taking out a second mortgage (sad, but true -- I know of people who have taken out loans for their wedding!). 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	First, here is the number one rule: never, ever, EVER throw a wedding with money you don't have. If you need to take out a loan of any sort, then it's time to think about other options. Remember, as spectacular and amazing as wedding days can be, it ultimately is just ONE day in your life. It's not worth going into debt for. Plus, there are so many ways you can be cost-effective. We chose to have our wedding on a Friday, which cost less than having it on a Saturday or Sunday. We also booked our venue when it was under renovations so we got an additional 15% off. We kept our wedding intimate with just over 70 guests, making costs for food and beverages much more manageable. We saved even more money because we didn't exchange wedding rings -- we don't value symbols and both hate wearing jewelry. Similarly, I didn't buy a garter for a garter toss, had cupcakes instead of a cake (we had Sprinkles cupcakes which our guests LOVED and it cost only half as much as a cake would've), and wore shoes we already own (I know shoes seem like a small detail but brides go crazy spending big $$$ on Jimmy Choos). Another important thing -- get your guests as involved as possible! I wanted everyone to feel engaged at my wedding (have you ever been to a wedding where you just didn't care to be there?) so many people had roles outside of just being a guest. Utilize their talents and resources. I collected glass jars from many family, friends, and neighbors. My sister and godfather were my photographers. And so on.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	So remember, just use your creativity and tap into your resources. Let your guests be a part of the experience. Just because something is a tradition doesn't mean you have to have it at your wedding. No need to spend money on silly traditions you don't care about. Also, just because something costs more doesn't mean it's better. And lastly, the most important element to our wedding was our amazing family and friends. With the right people, any event will be spectacular. And friends and family are priceless. :-)
