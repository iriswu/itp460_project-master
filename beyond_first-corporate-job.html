<div id="article-body">

	<p>
	<span class="first-word">My</span> twin sister and I have always wanted to work. Something about making our own money was so appealing and our shot at our first job came the the fall of 2000. We were 13 years old and our neighbor came to our house looking for a sub for her son's paper route. He was going out of town for a week and she wondered if we would take his route while he was gone. We were completely in disbelief that our neighbor thought we were responsible enough for such a task. This was our big break. With an immense sense of pride, we agreed to shadow her son for two days to learn the ropes.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	And so the week went. We folded, rubber banded, and delivered newspapers to our entire neighborhood everyday after school. We quickly learned the fastest route to take and even enlisted my brother and his friend to help us fold newspapers. This wasn't so bad and we would be paid $60 by the end of the week! The only day we were dreading was our last day of work, which was a Sunday. Sundays played by a different set of rules and all newspapers had to be delivered by 7am, which meant we needed to wake up at 4:30am to start folding. I remember my sister and I getting out of bed and setting up shop in the garage with wind howling outside and us shivering in the cold.  Somehow, we made it through the darkness on our bikes and had every house delivered except for one last row of houses. We sighed with relief and decided that the quickest way to complete this last set was to throw the newspaper on the porch rather than walking it up. This was a great plan and by our last house, I had gotten really confident with my throwing. I took a deep breathe and threw the newspaper on the porch. Except it didn't hit the porch. I had thrown it at a window and the window cracked. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We heard the people inside say, "What was that?!", and of course the logical thing to do was to hit our bikes and get the heck out of there. When we got home, we confessed to our parents what had happened and they insisted we go back and let the people know. Long story short, the window cost $100 to fix so the $60 we made went straight into the window, along with an additional $40. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We were down for a while about this whole experience but rather than letting it keep us down, we moved on. Our neighbor's son eventually offered us his route permanently, and along with our younger brother, we built a monopoly of newspaper routes in our town. Doing the paper route every day gave us exposure to many of our neighbors who offered us babysitting jobs on the side. By the time I was 16, I had saved $4,500 from my jobs, all stemmed from that ill-fated first week.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The moral of this story is that breaking windows and falling down will happen. Just don't let it discourage you from getting back up and taking another swing at it.
