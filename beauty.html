		<h2 class="article-header">Why I Stopped Dyeing My Hair<span class="article-date">Monday, February 4, 2013</span></h2>
		
		<div id="article-content">
			<p>
			As a tween, my greatest desire was to change my hair color. I believed in the "blondes have more fun" sentiment and saw so many things wrong with my dark brown hair and so many things right with any shade lighter than Espresso. Of course, my parents wouldn't let me dye my hair yet but I convinced them to buy me Sun-In (a product you spray in your hair to lighten it gradually with sun exposure) and used this product during every soccer practice. Over the course of a few weeks, my once healthy hair turned into a frizzy mass of streaky, brassy bronze -- but I was hooked. Anything was better than my real hair color.	
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Sun-In was my gateway drug to boxed hair dye, and by the time I was 14, I became a DIY hair color wannabe expert. About once every few months, I would buy a box of hair dye (discretely -- even thought my parents knew what was going on, I didn't want to rub it in their faces) and 45 minutes later, I would have a new me. After my first breakup with a boyfriend in high school, I decided it was time to join the big leagues and got my hair colored and highlighted professionally. FYI -- just because something is done by a "professional" doesn't mean it's better. By senior year in high school, I was switching between summery highlights and raven black every few months. And I started to notice a trend: anytime I wasn't feeling great about myself, I would make a hair appointment and change my look. Because that always solves the problem, right? What I also realized was that after breakups, I would go the lightest in hair color. 
			</p>

			<span>Me and my twin in 2007 (I'm on the right). This is the last time I would highlight my hair. </span>
			</div>
			
			<p>
			During the summer of 2007, I decided once and for all to stop dyeing my hair and to end this cycle of highlights, black hair, lighter highlights, and more goth-y black hair. I endured two years of painful two-tone hair while new hair grew in and finally, during the winter of 2009, the last bit of dyed hair was cut off. I had never felt more free and here are the three reasons why I finally stopped dyeing my hair:
			</p>
			
			<p>
			1. It's expensive: Getting my hair highlighted costed at least $75 each time (and these were prices from almost six years ago) and then I had to maintain my roots by going back to the salon for touch-ups and then I would dye it to a solid color at home and then I had to go back and get more highlights and then the roots would start showing again and then. It just never ended. It was a money pit and an expensive habit to have because the coloring just never ended. There were always touch-ups needed. I am happy to report that since the summer of 2007, I have spent exactly $0 on hair coloring.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			2. It's unhealthy: Think about it. You are rubbing this chemically substance into your scalp, a super absorbent area of skin, and letting this toxic mixture go into your blood stream. Yuck. Plus, you are inhaling the fumes from hair coloring every time you dye your hair. And your hair loses its structural integrity from the hair dye and becomes brittle and frizzy and gross. To compensate, you spend more $$ on hair care products to make it look shiny and nice, further supporting reason #1.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			3. It showed me I wasn't okay with who I am: Why did I feel this need to change my hair color instead of embracing who I am and how I was born? Why did I comfort myself when I was down by changing my hair color instead of dealing with the real issues at hand? Why am I forsaking my Chinese identity by believing lighter hair is better?
			</p>

			<span>Me and my bridesmaids. Seven girls with all natural hair. All natural beauties, no hair dye needed!</span>
			</div>
			
			<p>
			Perhaps reason #3 was the biggest reason why I stopped dyeing my hair. I finally started the journey of loving and embracing myself. I suddenly realized that how I come is good enough, that I don't need to alter or discolor myself to thrive in this world. I just need to be me.

			<h2 class="article-header">How To Spend Less On Clothes<span class="article-date">SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2012</span></h2>
			
			<p>
			Part of my journey these past few years has been streamlining my life and placing energy and resources into things that matter to me. And that, my friends, does not include spending hours shopping for clothes and throwing money at seasonal trends. I work in retail so I know the profit margins are greatest in clothing departments -- spending money on clothes just isn't good for your bottom line. If you want to spend less on clothes, I have only one rule for you: Buy less clothes. Look for comfy signature pieces that always work. Don't fall for stuff you'll only wear once. Less is more. People aren't here on earth to ohh and ahhover your clothes. They are here to spend time with you. My fiance always says, "Just because it costs more, doesn't mean it's better." Look for multipurpose clothes. Find something you LOVE and will always wear.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			That said, comfy signature pieces still make you look nice and stylish. Here is an example of a $60 dress I've worn to four weddings. Every time I wear it, people say, "Oh my gawd, I love your dress!!". It's a signature piece because it has stunning cream accents. But it's so subtle and unassuming that people never remember I've worn this dress before. And even if they do, so what? I didn't have to spend money on a new dress I'll never wear again.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I bought this dress in 2010 from a seller I found on Etsy.com. It's made out of a super comfy and breathable hemp material. She no longer makes it but here are three common sense tips on identifying comfy signature pieces:
			</p>
			
			<ol>
				<div class="article-imagewithcaption" id="beauty-art2-img1">
					<img src="imgs/beauty-cheapdress.png"  class="article-image" />
					<span> I am second from the right, sitting next to my always beautiful and ageless mother.</span>
				</div>	
				
				<li>It's always flattering. You can wear it regardless of how you feel that day about your body. This dress is flow-y enough that it's my go-to outfit for bloated days but is also cinched at the waist to always flatter my figure.</li>
				
				<div class="article-imagewithcaption" id="beauty-art2-img2">
					<img src="imgs/beauty-cheapdress-walking.png"  class="article-image" />
					<span>I am on the right.</span>
				</div>					
				
				<li>Buy something that is super comfortable and light-weight to wear. That way, you can wear it during the summer or layer on a coat during the cooler days. It's appropriate for all seasons! Yes, I live in California but I have layered this dress with tights and a coat for two St. Louis winters. Comfy materials I love include cotton, hemp, and bamboo. Materials I very much dislike: wool, leather, and anything synthetic.</li>
				
				<div class="article-imagewithcaption" id="beauty-art2-img3">
					<img src="imgs/beauty-cheapdress-twins.png" class="article-image"  />
					<br />
					<span>In Taiwan, no less! Here I am with my twin sister. You know which one I am.</span>
				</div>
				
				<li>Buy something that is versatile that you can dress up or down. When I wear red heels with this dress, I look like a rock star. When I dress it down with flats, I look like a comfortable fashionista.</li>
				
				<div class="article-imagewithcaption" id="beauty-art2-img4">
					<img src="imgs/beauty-cheapdress-fiancentwin.png" class="article-image" />
					<span>With my twin and fiance.</span>
				</div>
								
			</ol>
			
			<p>	
			Here are some other times I've worn this dress:
			</p>
			
			<div class="article-imagewithcaption" id="beauty-art2-img5">
					<img src="imgs/beauty-cheapdress-hawaii.png" class="article-image" />
					<span>At a luau in Hawaii.</span>
			</div>
			
			<div class="article-imagewithcaption" id="beauty-art2-img6">

					<span>At a networking event in Los Angeles.</span>

	<h2 class="article-header">Milk Gives You Pimples<span class="article-date">Tuesday, November 27, 2012</span></h2>
	
	<p>
	Perhaps one of the greatest lies we are told as kids is that milk is good for us and makes us grow big and strong. However, if there is one food group on the Standard American Diet's food pyramid that I recommend all my friends eliminate first, it would be dairy. Humans are the only mammals to drink milk into adulthood and we don't even drink our own species' milk! I have always had a natural aversion to milk...it just tasted like vomit to me. Also, dairy products in general were not kind to my digestive system. I remember several birthday parties with cheese pizzas and ice cream where I spent the whole night miserable with sharp abdominal pains in the bathroom.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Cows are injected with growth hormones to produce an abnormal amount of milk. Their udders become infected, and the bloody and pus-y messes inevitably end up in our milk. Antibiotics are then used to control the bleeding and pus, and if there's any nutritional value left in milk after that, it all gets pasteurized out anyway. So fatty milk with growth hormones, blood, pus, and antibiotics??? No, thanks.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I want to share a quick story about milk and the affects it has on skin. When Lane and I first started dating, he always had issues with his skin. He tried Clearasil and Proactiv with little success. These products sort-of controlled his acne but left his sensitive skin dry and irritated. I noticed he drank a glass of milk with every meal and suggested that maybe the milk was causing his skin to break out. He was fed up with using such harsh chemicals on his skin so he agreed to cut out milk for a week. Within three days, he skin completely cleared up and within a few weeks, his skin was beautiful and glow-y.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	But don't let me tell you what to do -- there is so much misinformation out there about health and nutrition that the best way to separate fact from industry-driven fiction is to experiment and try things out for yourself. Give up dairy products for a week and see what changes you notice.
