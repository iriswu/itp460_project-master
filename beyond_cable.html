	<h2 class="article-header">Why Cable Is For Dummies<br /> <span class="article-date">THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2012</span></h2>
</div>

<div id="article-body">

		<p>
		<span class="first-word">Growing</span> up, I worshiped cable. Watching TV was all I wanted to do and all I did when given the chance. My summers consisted of lying on the couch all day watching the summer lineups on my favorite channels, including Disney, Nickelodeon, TLC, and the Food Network. What made this experience even better was mindlessly eating prepackaged food while watching show after show. Sure, I did other things such as karate and swim lessons during the summer time, but those commitments only took up 2-3 hours every day. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I had a friend who didn't have cable and I remember being so shocked when he told me. "So what do you do all day?!", I naively asked. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Ever since I moved out of my parents' house, I vowed to never have cable TV again. The reason why is because the more I opened my eyes, the more I realized how cable is for dummies. It seriously is a brain drain and I wish I had those summers back so I could've done something productive and meaningful with my time. It depresses me to think about all the hours I lost in my life to TV.
		
			<ol>
				<li>Cable costs money. Yes, unless you are mooching off of your neighbor, cable is going to run you $50-200 every month. That's a lot of money to be spending on something you don't need. That's enough money for a week's worth of groceries or to fund a new hobby or two every month. And if there is a show you HAVE to watch, you can probably find it for free online.</li>
				<li>Cable makes you a slave. A reason why cable TV is appealing to some is because you can watch an episode when it first premieres. However, then you have to adjust your life to fit around its scheduling. I can't even tell you how many times a phone conversation has been cut short because "My favorite show is on now!" or "I need to go watch my show!". People become slaves to their TV. A great example is my dad, who has a bazillion channels and records shows all the time. He gets stressed out if he can't watch everything because he needs more space to record even more shows. So it becomes this endless cycle of recording, watching, erasing, and recording more. It just never ends. And yes, it's very stressful for him. </li>
				<li>Cable makes you passive. And fat. You are sitting in front of a TV for hours on end, probably killing time and eating whatever junk you have in your house. Rather than taking a jog or having dinner with your friend, you are just sitting and watching a box. I can't even recall most of the stuff I've watched, proving how passive we become when watching TV. Very rarely is anything retained.</li>
				<li>Cable subjects you to hardcore marketing. 20 minutes out of every hour is spent on commercials. That's one third of your time watching TV that yet another plastic junk or fast food chain is marketed to you. Have you ever seen a commercial where the product or food marketed is something you actually need or is going to enrich your life?</li>
				<li>Cable is a clutch. My sister lets the TV run 24/7 because she likes the background noise. Another person I know can only fall asleep with the TV on. Is this normal?</li>
				<li></li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		So break free, cut out the noise, and find yourself. Embrace silence. Cherish your time. And enjoy your life. I promise you won't regret it.
